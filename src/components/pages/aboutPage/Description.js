                    Graduate of the engineering school,
                    ESIEA, since 2023, it's been 
                    4 years now that I have
                    specialised in software
                    development. 
               </p>
               <p>
                    My autonomy and
                    dynamism make me
                    proactive on complex group projects.

                    For several years I've been
                    passionate about software 
                    development of all kinds. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has led me to create
                    various projects such
                    as this website.
